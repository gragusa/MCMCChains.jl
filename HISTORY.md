# MCMCChains Changelog

## 7.6.0

Compatibility for PrettyTables@3.

Minimum Julia version bumped to 1.10.

## 7.5.0

Add a method for `MCMCDiagnosticTools.bfmi(::Chains)`. This computes the Bayesian Fraction of Missing Information for a chain or set of chains. Previously one had to extract a raw `Array` from the `Chains` object and pass that to `bfmi`.
